        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Jollof Rice is a one-pot rice dish popular in many West African countries. 
          Despite several regional variations, as well as a culturally sensitive debate 
          between Ghanaians and Nigerians over the dish's origins, the popularity of 
          Jollof Rice has spread to become the best known African dish outside the continent.  
          It’s widely accepted as the forefather of the Louisianan dish Jambalaya.  
          Serve with fish, chicken, beef, eggs, or turkey.

            <li>Add to the blender mixture that was set aside and blend all together.</li>
